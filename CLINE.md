# Cline Bootloader — Delphi AI Co-Engineer

This file serves as the entry point for Cline to load the Delphi AI Co-Engineer context.

## Quick Start

1. **Core Instructions** are loaded automatically from `.clinerules/` directory
2. **Skills** are available in `.cline/skills/`
3. **Workflows** are available in `.clinerules/workflows/`

| `laravel-create-package-method` | Create/refactor Laravel packages with explicit boundaries |

## Usage

### For Flutter Work

1. Start with `flutter-architecture-adherence` skill
2. Based on the task, invoke the appropriate workflow:
   - Creating controller → `create-controller` workflow
   - Creating domain → `create-domain` workflow
   - Creating screen → `create-screen` workflow
   - Creating repository → `create-repository` workflow

### For Code Review

Use the smell detection skills:
- `flutter-smell-async-navigation` for navigation issues
- `flutter-smell-mounted-checks` for lifecycle issues
- `flutter-smell-build-side-effects` for side effect issues

## Delivery Authority

- Cline planning is advisory by default.
- Implementation authority requires Delphi TODO governance:
  - active tactical TODO,
  - explicit `APROVADO` before project-modifying actions,
  - Decision Adherence Gate evidence before delivery.
- See `.clinerules/model-decision/shared-todo-driven-execution.md` and `.clinerules/workflows/docker-todo-driven-execution.md`.

## Verification

Before starting downstream project work, verify context availability:

```bash
bash delphi-ai/verify_context.sh
```

This command is read-only by default. If it fails only on Delphi-managed links/artifacts, run:

```bash
bash delphi-ai/verify_context.sh --repair
bash delphi-ai/verify_context.sh
```

For governance mirror validation after readiness passes, run:

```bash
bash delphi-ai/verify_adherence_sync.sh
```

## Source of Truth
